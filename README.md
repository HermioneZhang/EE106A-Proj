This is a robot project written in Python with ROS and OpenCV packages, under collaboration of the following members:
```
Shijie Gao (shijie.gao@berkeley.edu)
Yunfan Song (yunfansong@berkeley.edu)
Lichang Xu (xulichang1995@berkeley.edu)
Gongbo Yang (gongboyang@berkeley.edu)
Lingyao Zhang (lingyaoz1995@gmail.com)
```

Note: The robot uses Baxter-frame hardware provided by EE106A course staff at UC Berkeley. The robot can solve Rubik's puzzle within a short period of time. There are three main components: image processing, cubic solver, and actual hardware manipulation. Code details can be found easily in each directory. Feel free to contact the developers if you encounter any questions.
