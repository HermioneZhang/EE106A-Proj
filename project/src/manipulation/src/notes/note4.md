1. roslaunch baxter_moveit_config move_group.launch
If the problem is: cannot find trajectory controller.... (anything related to trajectory)
then just run
```
rosrun baxter_interface joint_trajectory_action_server.py
```

2. If anything unexpected happens and you don't why, just restart the robot!!!
The restart button is behind the robot and on its back.

3. Why can't I move the right arm??!!!

***error message for the right arm***
